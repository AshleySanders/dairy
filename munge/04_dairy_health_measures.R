# Project: Herd Management Strategy Analysis â€“ Dairy Cow Health Features
#
# Description:
# Aggregates raw dairy health event records into per-cow summary variables.
# Filters out routine and preventive entries (dry-offs, vaccinations) to focus on
# actual health problems. Outputs are cached for later joining into cow_features.
#
# Inputs:
# - dairy_health (cached data frame with one row per health event for each cow)
# - Helper function clean_ani() to standardize AniLifeNumber formatting
#
# Outputs:
# - dairy_health_problems: filtered health events (cached)
# - cow_health_summary: per-cow aggregated health metrics
#
# Dependencies:
# - dplyr, stringr, lubridate (via tidyverse)
# - cache() function from ProjectTemplate or similar
