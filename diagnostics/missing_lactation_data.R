# Script: missing_lactation_data.R
# Purpose: Identify cows with missing milk production data after calving by
#          joining lactation, milk, and animal exit data. Includes diagnostics
#          for dry-off dates, lactation length, and calving-to-insemination
#          intervals.
# Notes:   Focused on Farm1 after Lely installation (2016â€“2023).
